Welcome to the Launchpad walkthrough! This guide will take you through the essential steps to integrate Algolia's powerful search and discovery capabilities into your application. Whether you’re a developer or a small business owner using popular content management platforms, Launchpad will provide clear, step-by-step instructions to help you set up and customize your Algolia search implementation. By the end of this walkthrough, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to configure your index, upload data, and create a seamless search experience for your users.

During the Launchpad, you will:

1. **Import Data**: the first step for our search journey is to _index_ data to make searchable.
2. **Design Your Search Interface**: we'll help you design an example search interface to play with.
3. **Add Searchable Attributes**: these searchable attributes will help users find what they're looking for
4. **Configure Search Relevancy**: the magic of Algolia—ensuring _the right results_ are returned for any query
5. **Implement Search**: take the search interface you designed and add it to your project to see in action
