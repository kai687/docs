During the second step of the Launchpad, you will design a very simplistic example of a search experience. This design will pull attributes from the data you recently pushed to Algolia. There are four attributes you can map:

**Primary Text**: this is the most important text you want customers to see when searching through your content. This is normally things like the _name_ or _title_ of your record.

**Secondary Text**: this is additional content you pair with your primary text to help describe the record. This could be things like the _description_, _overview_, _summary_, etc.

**Tertiary Text**: this is supplementary content used to quickly qualify, categorize or connote something of the record. This could be things like _likes_, _genre_, _category_, _orders_, etc.

**Image URL**: if your records contain an image URL, you can use it here to display an image related to the record returned in results.

## Searching your data

Once you've designed your interface, you can immediately begin searching the content on the right side in real-time. This will help you see how quick Algolia search results are. At first, this will return results based on _any attribute within your record_. We will help you narrow down the attributes you want users to be able to search for in the following section.
