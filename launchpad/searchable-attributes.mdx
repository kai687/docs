During this step, you'll add the searchable attributes you want to allow users to search. The Launchpad, will automatically add`Primary Text`, `Secondary Text` and `Tertiary Text` values you added in the previous step to your searchable attributes. Here, you may delete or add attributes as you see fit.

In the above movie example, the customer can search the movies by `title`, `overview` (movie description), or `genres`. If your movie dataset had other attributes like `cast.actors` or `cast.directors`, you would not be able to search through these attributes. So, if you wanted to look for `Nicolas Cage` or `Tim Burton`, it would not return results unless those names are within the `title`, `overview` or `genres` attributes.

## Reasons to add searchable attributes not present in your UI

- **Enhanced Search Flexibility**: Sometimes, users may want to search for specific details or attributes that are not prominently displayed on the UI but are still important to them. Allowing searches across all attributes ensures that users can find relevant results based on their unique criteria.
- **Comprehensive Data Access**: Your application may have extensive data associated with each record, only a portion of which is displayed on the UI due to design constraints or user interface considerations. Enabling searches across all attributes ensures users have access to the full breadth of available information.
- **Advanced Filtering and Analysis**: Customers may want to perform complex queries or filter results based on attributes that are not immediately visible. This capability allows for more sophisticated exploration, catering to users with specific needs.
- **Future-Proofing and Scalability:** As your application evolves and new attributes or data points become relevant, allowing searches across other attributes ensures that your search functionality remains flexible and adaptable over time. This future-proofs your application against changing user needs and business requirements.
